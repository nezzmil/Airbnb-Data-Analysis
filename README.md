# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an Airbnb dataset using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, statistical summaries, and visualization techniques to uncover insights about pricing trends, neighborhood patterns, and property characteristics. Tools like Pandas and NumPy were used for data manipulation, while Seaborn and Matplotlib enabled effective visualization through histograms, boxplots, and correlation analysis.

## Project Goals  
Analyze Airbnb listings to uncover insights such as:  
Price distribution  
Most popular neighborhoods  
Room type trends  
How has number of reviews change over with time  
Relationships between variables
